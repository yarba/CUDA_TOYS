|      How to build and run CUDA/GPU examples       |
+---------------------------------------------------+

1. This exercise is based on the example from the following link:

   https://devblogs.nvidia.com/even-easier-introduction-cuda  

   Several things (setup, cmake, etc.) have been added.

2. It is basically the same as ../build_with_nvcc/add_v3.cu example
   but instead of building it directly with nvcc, here we use cmake.
   
   Setup the environment:
   
   source setup-cuda.sh
   
   (it'll setup gcc, nvcc, cmake ) 

   Build it:

   mkdir bin 
   cd bin
   cmake -DProject=add ..
   make
   
3. Depending on the nvcc flags, one may or may not be able to **fully** profile 
   the application with nvprof, i.e. nvprof will run but in some case it may not
   be able to profile the **kernel(s)** which is actually the most interesting part.
   See comments in CMakeLists.txt on this matter.
   
4. Other cmake options (that I haven't tried yet)

   4.1 separate compilation option:
       set(CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)
   4.2 debug mode
       add "-G -lineinfo" to CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS 
   4.3 sm for Optix and Microarchitecture
       -arch=sm_61 (Pascal - P100)
       
5. If one wants to submit to batch (instead of running interactively on Wilson/gpu node),
   here an example:
   
   sbatch --nodes=1 -p gpu --gres=gpu:1 --nodelist=gpu4 --time=1:00:00 -A g4p <your-exec>
